<h1>Creative statement draft</h1>
<p>Neffertti Villegas, a student living in New Jersey and working in New York City, who works with cameras to capture moments in everyday life. Some of the tools used can vary from an Iphone camera, disposable film, or a digital camera. With framing and the rule of thirds kept in mind to get the right shot. Everyday beauty and special moments is what inspires me to pull out the camera.</p>
